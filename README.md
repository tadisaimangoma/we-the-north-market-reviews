## Real User Voices on We The North Market

> “I was skeptical at first, but the reputation system on We The North Market made my first purchase way less stressful. Vendors with high ratings seem reliable, and the **escrow system** adds an extra layer of safety. Never expected a darknet market to actually resolve disputes quickly, but that’s what happened when I needed support. For Canadian buyers, it’s a breath of fresh air.”  
— *Derek, frequent buyer*
